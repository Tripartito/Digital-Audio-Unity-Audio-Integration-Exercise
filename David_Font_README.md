# Digital-Audio-Unity-Audio-Integration-Exercise

We've added all the SFXs we could for character gameplay, even some not asked for such as:
- Hurt Sounds
- Death Sounds
- Close-to-death HeartBeat sounds
- Weapon impact depending on material hit and weapon used

All SFX sounds that can be randomized have been programmed to be with all possible variants.
